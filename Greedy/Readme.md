## Fractional Knapsack Problem

An implementation of the Fractional Knapsack Algorithm in C.

### Description

The Fractional Knapsack Algorithm is a Greedy Algorithm used to solve the Knapsack Problem. Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and a knapsack with a weight capacity, the algorithm finds the most valuable combination of items that can be put in the knapsack.

The algorithm selects objects to include in the knapsack based on their value-to-weight ratio, starting with the highest ratio and moving down the list until the knapsack is full. If an object cannot fit completely in the knapsack, it is included partially based on its value-to-weight ratio.
