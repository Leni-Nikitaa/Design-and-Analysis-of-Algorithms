# Linear Search

This directory contains an implementation of the Linear Search Algorithm in C.

## Description

The Linear Search Algorithm, also known as a sequential search, is a simple search algorithm that iterates through each element of an array and compares it with the target value. If a match is found, it returns the index of the matching element in the array. If no match is found, it returns `-1`.

The implementation of the Linear Search Algorithm in this repository takes an array of integers and the size of the array as input, as well as the target value that is being searched for. The algorithm then iterates through the array and compares each element with the target value until a match is found or the end of the array is reached.
