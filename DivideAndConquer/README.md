# Divide and Conquer 

This repository contains C programs that implements the Divide and conquer algorithm for different problems.

## Binary Search

A C program that implements the binary search algorithm for searching an element in a sorted array.

### Algorithm

The binary search algorithm is a divide and conquer algorithm that searches for an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The algorithm compares the middle element of the search interval with the target element and continues the search in the left or right half of the interval depending on the comparison until the target element is found or the interval is empty.
