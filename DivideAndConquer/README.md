# Divide and Conquer 

This repository contains C programs that implements the Divide and conquer algorithm for different problems.

## Binary Search

A C program that implements the binary search algorithm for searching an element in a sorted array.

### Algorithm

The binary search algorithm is a divide and conquer algorithm that searches for an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The algorithm compares the middle element of the search interval with the target element and continues the search in the left or right half of the interval depending on the comparison until the target element is found or the interval is empty.

## Merge Sort

An implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm in C programming language.

### Introduction

Merge Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that sorts an array or a list of elements by breaking it down into smaller sub-arrays, sorting those sub-arrays, and then merging them back together in a sorted order. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n), making it efficient for large datasets.

This implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm is written in C programming language.
