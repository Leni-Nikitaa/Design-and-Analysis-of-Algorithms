# Bubble Sort

This directory contains an implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in C.

## Algorithm 

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list.

The Bubble Sort algorithm has a worst-case and average complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>), where n is the number of items being sorted. It is not suitable for large data sets.

The implementation in this repository takes an array of integers as input, and sorts the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
