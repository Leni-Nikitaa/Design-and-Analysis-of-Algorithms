# Depth-First Search (DFS) 

This directory contains an implementation of the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm for graph traversal in C.

## Description

The Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm is used to explore or traverse all the vertices of a graph by starting from a given source vertex and visiting its adjacent vertices recursively. It continues this process until all reachable vertices have been visited, and then backtracks to explore other unvisited vertices until all vertices have been explored.

In this implementation, the graph is represented using an adjacency list, where each vertex has a linked list of adjacent vertices. The algorithm uses a recursive approach and a visited array to keep track of the visited vertices.
